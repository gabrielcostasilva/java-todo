# PURE JAVA TO-DO APP
This project introduces a web To-Do app that allows adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed. 

We use this project in the [online certification Java program](http://pos-graduacao-ead.cp.utfpr.edu.br/java/), for the module I teach on Java for Web applications.

## Project Overview
This project is identitical to the [no-persistence](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/java-todo/tree/no-persistence), but with no Web annotations.

> This project requires unit tests to show off its features.
